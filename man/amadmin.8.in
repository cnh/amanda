.TH AMADMIN 8
.SH NAME
amadmin \- administrative interface to control Amanda backups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B amadmin
.I config
.I command
[
.I command options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Amadmin
performs various administrative tasks on the
.I config
Amanda configuration.
.LP
See the
.IR amanda (8)
man page for more details about Amanda.
.SH COMMANDS
All commands that take
.I hostname
[
.I disks
]
parameters operate on all the disks in the
.I disklist
for that
.I hostname
if no disks are specified.
.P
.I Disks
are regular expressions,
so "sd0" will match disks "sd0a" and "sd0g"
and "/mnt" will match "/mnt", "/mnt/a", and "/mnt/b".
To match only "/mnt",
use "^/mnt$".
This is the same mechanism used by
.IR amrestore(8) .
.LP
.TP
.B version
Show the current version and some compile time and runtime parameters.
.TP
.P1 force hostname [ disks ]
Force the
.I disks
on
.I hostname
to do a full level 0 backup during the next Amanda run.
.TP
.P1 unforce hostname [ disks ]
Undo a previous
.B force
command.
.TP
.P1 "find\fP [ \fB--sort\fP \fBhkdlb\fP ]\fB" hostname [ disks ]
Display
all backups currently on tape for each disk.
The tape label,
file number,
and status are displayed.
.IP
The
.B --sort
option changes the sort order using the following flags:
.RS
.LP
.de SO
\fB\\$1\fP	\\$2
.br
..
.SO h "host name"
.SO k "disk name"
.SO d "dump date"
.SO l "backup level"
.SO b "tape label"
.RE
.IP
An uppercase letter reverses the sort order for that key.
The default sort order is
.BR hkdlb .
.TP
.P2 delete hostname disks
Delete the specified
.I disks
from the Amanda
database.
.IP
Note: if you do not also remove the disk from the
.I disklist
file, Amanda will treat it as a new disk on the next run.
.TP
.B tape
Display the label of the tape Amanda is expecting to write to next.
See also
.IR amcheck (8).
.TP
.B bumpsize
Display the current bump threshold parameters, calculated for all backup
levels.
.TP
.B balance
Display the distribution of full backups throughout the dump schedule.
.TP
.P3 export [ hostname [ disks ] ]
Convert records from the Amanda database
to a text format that may be transmitted to another Amanda
machine and
.BR import ed.
.TP
.B import
Convert
.BR export ed
records read from standard input to a form Amanda uses
and insert them into the database on this machine.
.TP
.P3 disklist [ hostname [ disks ] ]
Display the
.I disklist
information for each of the
.I disks
on
.I hostname
(or all hosts).
Mostly used for debugging.
.TP
.P1 info hostname [ disks ]
Display the
database record for each of the
.I disks
on
.IR hostname .
Mostly used for debugging.
.SH EXAMPLES
Request three specific file systems on
.I machine-a
get a full level 0 backup during the next Amanda run.
.LP
Note the use of "^/$" to get the root file system.
Without the extra regular expression characters, just "/" would
have matched all the file systems on
.IR machine-a .
.LP
.RS
.EX
$ amadmin @DEFAULT_CONFIG@ force machine-a "^/$" /var /usr
amadmin: machine-a:/ is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
amadmin: machine-a:/var is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
amadmin: machine-a:/usr is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
.EE
.RE
.LP
Request all file systems on
.I machine-b
get a full level 0 backup during the next Amanda run.
.RE
.LP
.RS
.EX
$ amadmin @DEFAULT_CONFIG@ force machine-b
amadmin: machine-b:/ is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
amadmin: machine-b:/var is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
amadmin: machine-b:/usr is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
amadmin: machine-b:/home is set to a forced level 0 tonight.
.EE
.RE
.LP
Undo the previous
.B force
request for
.I /home
on
.IR machine-b .
The other file systems will still get a full level 0 backup.
.LP
.RS
.EX
$ amadmin @DEFAULT_CONFIG@ unforce machine-b /home
amadmin: force command for machine-b:/home cleared.
.EE
.RE
.LP
Locate tapes holding
.I /var
from
.IR machine-c .
The
.I file
column tells you which file on the tape has the backup
(file number zero is a tape label).
The
.I status
column tells you whether the backup was successful or had
some type of error.
.LP
.RS
.EX

.LP
Forget about the
.I /workspace
disk on
.IR machine-d .
If you do not also remove the disk from the
.I disklist
file, Amanda will treat it as a new disk on the next run.
.LP
.RS
.EX
$ amadmin @DEFAULT_CONFIG@ delete machine-d /workspace
amadmin: machine-d:/workspace deleted from database.
amadmin: NOTE: you'll have to remove these from the disklist yourself.
.EE
.RE
.LP
Find the next tape Amanda will use
(in this case, 
.IR 123456 ).
.LP
.RS
.EX
$ amadmin @DEFAULT_CONFIG@ tape
The next Amanda run should go onto tape 123456 or a new tape.
.EE
.RE
.LP
Show how well full backups are balanced across the dump cycle.
The
.I due-date
column is the day the backups are due for a full backup.
.I #fs
shows the number of filesystems doing full backups that night, and
.I orig KB
and
.I out KB
show the estimated total size of the backups
before and after any compression, respectively.
.LP
The
.I balance
column shows how far off that night's backups are from the average size
(shown at the bottom of the balance column).
Amanda tries to keep the backups within +/- 5%,
but since the amount of data on each filesystem is always changing,
and Amanda will never delay backups just to rebalance the schedule,
it is common for the schedule to fluctuate by larger percentages.
In particular,
in the case of a tape or backup failure,
a bump will occur the following night,
which will not be smoothed out until the next pass through the schedule.
.LP
The last line also shows an estimate of how many Amanda runs will be
made between full backups for a file system.
In the example, a file system will probably have a full backup done
every eight times Amanda is run (e.g. every eight days).
