.TH AMFLUSH 8
.SH NAME
amflush \- flush Amanda backup files from holding disk to tape
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B amflush
[
.B -f
]
.I config
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Amflush
writes all Amanda backups from holding disk to tape,
and updates the Amanda info database and tape list accordingly.
The backups stay in the holding disk when something is wrong with the tape
at the time
.B amdump
is run.
When this happens, the problem must be corrected and
.B amflush
run by hand.
.PP
.B Amflush
will look in the holding disk specified by the
.I amanda.conf
file in @CONFIG_DIR@/\fIconfig\fR
for any non-empty Amanda work directories.
It then prompts you to select a directory.
The work directories on the holding disk are named by the date at the time
.B amdump
was run, e.g.\&
.IR 19910215 .
.PP
.B Amflush
normally detaches from the tty and runs as a background process.
With the
.B -f
option,
.B amflush
stays in the foreground.
This is useful if
.B amflush
is run as part of another script that, for example, advances the tape
after the flush is completed.
.LP
See the
.IR amanda (8)
man page for more details about Amanda.
.SH EXAMPLE
.B Amflush
will search for holding areas associated with the
.I PUCC
configuration.
After you select which holding area to flush,
.B amflush
writes the data to tape, updates the databases and sends
a mail report similar to
.IR amdump (8).
