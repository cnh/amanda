Please read the CHANGES file for news since release 2.3.0.4

Changes in release 2.3.0.4
* New chg-generic.conf option 'multieject' added which lets
  chg-generic work on tape drives that need multiple 'mt offline'
  commands.  See examples/chg-generic.conf for more information.
* New configure options:
  --with-db=DBLIB	   Force database library choice from {db,dbm,gdbm,ndbm}
  --enable-buffered-dump   Use buffered sockets on server for faster dumps
  --with-group=GROUPNAME   Install all files into group GROUPNAME
* Include the file seagate-changer.c which controls
  Seagate/Conner/Archive autoloading DAT drive on NetBSD systems.
* Add a new amanda.conf option named "starttime" which is used in the
  dumptype configuration.  It takes one argument which is a time of day
  (local timezone) formated as either hhmm or hmm (no `.'s, no `:'s,
  just an integer).  This tells Amanda to start a particular dump at
  the given time.
* Index files are now retrieved from the clients through amandad, not rsh/rcp.
* Fix configure bug when multiple invocations would not do the correct things.
* Better fully qualified domain name support.
* Many little dumper fixes.
* Remove C style comments from amrmtape and fix a bug when there is
  only one tape in the tapelist.
* More declarations of Unix system functions for those OSes that do not
  have declarations.
* Fix --with-mmap configure bug.

Changes in release 2.3.0.4b3
* Include amplot-2.2.6 which makes plots of the amdump files for performance
  improvements.  Amplot requires gnuplot and a version of awk that
  understands command line variable assignment.
* Include amoverview which creates a list of each disk dumped and the level
  and success or failure of those dumps over a complete tapecycle.
* Amanda now supports backups of clients in different domains.  Requires
  using the configure --with-fqdn options and fully qualified domain
  names (FQDNs) in the disklist file.
* rth-changer checks all system calls for valid returns.
* no-changer and hp-changer use different status files and do more checking.
* amrestore works again with gzip compressed tapes.
* New setuid program rundump for systems where dump must run as root.
* Setuid programs are now installed o-rwx for tighter security.
* Fix bug where if Amanda was not configured using the --with-bsd-security
  configure option, Amanda would not connect to the client machines.  This
  is now fixed.
* Rundump and runtar now check if the proper user is invoking them.
* Amanda now can use gdbm if the compatibility header files are not installed.
* Bug fixes for gnutar file exclusions.
* Fix bug in sendsize which would loop forever if debugging was not turned on.
* Bug fixes in Samba code.
* More configure and bug fixes for HP-UX, m88k-motorola-sysv4, SGI, OSF, and
  Ultrix systems.

Changes in release 2.3.0.4b2
* New tape changer script (rth-changer) for the Robotic Tape Handling system.
* Include amindex-1.0 from Alan McIvor.
* Gnutar incrementals should now work.
* amgetidx now caches if a remote client is reachable.
* amanda.conf settings used before --with-dbdir and --with-logdir settings
  in various scripts.
* New configure options:
  --with-mmap				force mmap() instead of shared memory
  --with-gnutar-listed-incremental=DIR	gnutar directory lists go in DIR
  --enable-gnutar-atime-preserve	gnutar preserves atime, do not use
  --with-pid-debug-files		use pid in /tmp debugging filenames
* Samba support must now be explicitly included using --with-smblcient.
* Amanda now compiles with K&R compilers.
* Better AIX, Linux, OSF support.
* configure checks if /dev/r devices exist or not.
* Amanda uses POSIX fcntl locking before flock or lockf locking if available.
* dumper.c uses less aggressive I/O values for SunOS server support.
* Many bug fixes in the configure script for various platforms.
* Many bug fixes to codes.

Changes in release 2.3.0.4b1
* Configuration now uses configure.  Build environment now uses
  automake and autoconf.
* Samba PC client backup support added.
* New programs and scripts:
  amrmtape: invalidate the contents of an existing backup tape
  amverify: check Amanda tapes for gnutar driven backups.
  hp-changer: script for a HP DAT changer.
  no-changer: make a single tape appear like an infinite count tape stacker.
* New options added to programs:
  amadmin: `amadmin <conf> version' shows version information.
  amtape: `amtape <conf> current' shows the current tape label,
* Amanda now supports server side compression of dumps on the tape
  host.  Use the srvcompress option in amanda.conf.
* Better gnutar support for indexing.  Amanda now lets you exclude
  files from the dump.
* Tape planning improvements.
* Email reports have better formating for disks with long mount points.
* Tighter DNS checking added to amandad.
* More debugging added to several programs.
* Amdump now calls amgetidx and amtrmidx.
* Better support for multidomain environments.
* Contains amindex-0.3 from Alan McIvor.
* Many bug fixes and compiler warnings handled.

Changes in release 2.3.0.3
* Amadmin uses regular expression matching to match disks.
* Expand the column width of the disk names from reporter.
* Contains amindex-0.2 from Alan McIvor.
* Many bug fixes.

Changes in release 2.3.0.2
* Bug fixes.

Changes in release 2.3.0.1
* Contains amindex-0.1 from Alan McIvor.
* Bug fixes.

Changes in release 2.3.0 alpha
* A number of material bugs fixed, including fixes incorporated into
  John Stoffel's WPI patches to amanda, which he called 2.2.6.5.
* Backup files larger than 2 GB now supported.  The current limit is
  2^31 Kbytes (2 terabytes), which should hold us for a few more years
  (1/2 :-).
* Support for GNUTAR-based backups.
* Support for writing to multiple tapes (sequentially) in one run.
* Support for multiple backups in parallel from the same client host.
* Records from the curinfo database can be exported and imported
  to/from a textual format.  This allows fixing a corrupted database by
  running the text version through a script and reimporting it.
  Individual records or the entire database can be exported/imported.

Changes in release 2.2.6
* A number of material bugs fixed.
* A lot of lint picked in the whole package.
* The documentation is now reasonably up to date.
* This version has been locally compiled and at least the client side
  tested on the following systems:
	SunOS 4.1.3	IRIX 5.2
	Solaris 2.3	BSDI BSD/386 1.1
	Ultrix 4.2	NetBSD 1.0
	DEC OSF/1 2.0	AIX 3.2
  I don't have any HP/UX machines locally to try it on, but I've
  tracked patches submitted by Neal Becker <neal@ctd.comset.com>, so
  I'm reasonably confident that 2.2.6 shouldn't be far from the mark on
  that platform.

Changes in release 2.2.5
* SYSV shared memory no longer required on server side if mmap is
  available.
* Supports GZIP compression.
* Supports use of mount names as well as device names in disk list
  (eg "/usr" instead of "sd0g").
* Amanda now thinks in real-time - you may run it several times a day
  if you wish, and it won't get confused.
* Supports Kerberos 4 security as well as BSD-style .rhosts, including
  encrypting files over the net.  The Kerberos support is available as
  a separate add-on package - see the file KERBEROS.HOW-TO-GET on the
  ftp site.
* Improved network protocol - faster startup, no longer dump specific,
  hooks in place for non-dump clients.
* Client-side checks in amcheck - can check sanity of all client hosts
  very quickly.
* Supports multiple holding disks, and load balances between them.
