2.4.3b3

This release include a change in the behavior of the exclude option
in a dumptype. It it now possible to have many 'exclude' and many
'exclude list' simultaneously. In previous release, only the last
one was used. Look at the amanda man page for a description.
The command 'amadmin <config> disklist' will show the exclude used.

You need to upgrade the server and client to use multiple exclude, you
will get the following message from amcheck if your client is not upgraded:
  ahost   /usr lev 0 FAILED [badly formatted response from ahost]

The new 'include' option in a dumptype and the new format of a disklist
entry (diskdevice different than the diskname) make it easier to separate
a disk in multiple disklist entry using GNUTAR. Look at the amanda man page
and example/disklist file for example on how to use it.

You need to upgrade the server and client to use 'include' or the new
disklist format.
