In my DAT drive (HP DAT in DEC StorageWorks enclosure), for 120m 
tapes (with compression), I use (and it's just the numbers that work 
for me, I have not made a scientific research to get the optimal 
values):

define tapetype DAT {
    comment "DAT tape drives"
    length 8000 mbytes          # these numbers are not accurate
    filemark 100 kbytes         # but you get the idea
    speed 400 kbytes
}

I have a HP1533 and a seagate drive (Archive Python SCSI message).
I use for both drives:

define tapetype DAT2 {
    comment "DAT tape drives"
    length 3000 mbytes
    filemark 250 kbytes
    speed 400 kbytes
}

This is a very conservative setting, but from some tape overflows
i got the impression that 4GB is unformatted capacity and
you get somewhere between 3GB and 3.4GB in real data.

the python is used only for testing. I don´t know if it 
has more capacity then the HP.

I have a seagate drive (Archive Python 4mm Helical Scan SCSI message).
Based on the output from a series of ufsdumps I use:

define tapetype DAT2 {
    comment "DAT tape drives"
    length 4000 mbytes
    filemark 63 kbytes
    speed 500 kbytes
}

>I am trying to configure a Quantum DLT tapedrive for use with Amanda.
>Does anybody have the correct define string to go in the amanda.conf file??

Don't know if it is correct, but it works fine:

define tapetype DLT4-2 {
	comment "DLT4000 with Compaq III tapes"
	length 10000 mbytes
	filemark 8 kbytes
	speed 1250 kbytes
}

We are not using DLT hardware compression because amanda does compression
itself.

This dumps 18 machines with 115 filesystems on a DEC3000/300X every night
(4 nights a week) with 4 to 13 GBytes (avg. 7.2 GBytes) of data depending
on the dumplevel (tapecycle 16 tapes).

I use a Quantum DLT tape drive on an SGI, and found that the following
tapetype entry works very nicely. I use 10 GB tapes, and don't use the
tape drive compression, since Amanda already does a lot of compression.

define tapetype DLT {
    comment "DLT tape drives"
    length 10000 mbytes
    filemark 8 kbytes
    speed 2500 kbytes
}

define tapetype DLT-4000 {

    filemark 8 kbytes
    speed 1500 kbytes
}

Here's what we use for DEC TZ87 CompacTape III drives:

define tapetype DEC-TZ87 {
    comment "DEC TZ87 DLT CompacTape III"
    length 12000 mbytes
    filemark 8 kbytes
    speed 2500 kbytes
}

define tapetype DEC-TZ87-NC {
    comment "DEC TZ87 DLT CompacTape III, no hardware compression"
    length 10000 mbytes
    filemark 8 kbytes
    speed 1250 kbytes
}

The actual maximum capacity of a TZ87 with compression turned on is 20000 
mbytes, but you can't be guaranteed of that compression factor, especially 
when you are sending already-compressed stuff to the tape.  So we fudge and 
say the capacity is only 12000 mbytes.  That's not a lot of gain over the 
uncompressed case, but every little bit counts.

IBM RS/6000 model C10 with IBM branded 5GB 8mm (112m) tape drive.

define tapetype EXB-8500 {
    comment "Exabyte EXB-8500 drive on decent machine"
    length 4200 mbytes
    filemark 48 kbytes
    speed 505 kbytes
}

IIRC, the EXB-8500 definition came included w/ the 2.3.0 example files.
Although the definition is not new, the IBM 5GB tape drive is a data point
for that definition.

For what it's worth, we use:

define tapetype EXB-8500 {
    comment "Exabyte EXB-8500 drive"
    length 5000 mbytes
    filemark 48 kbytes
    speed 474 kbytes
}

For our Sun-packaged Exabyte-8500 tape drive.  The filemark was taken
from the Amanda examples for that drive -- caveat emptor.

From: euler@lavielle.com (Lutz Euler)

Unfortunately I can not provide any new information,
but here is my configuration anyway:

Amanda version: 2.3.0
tape drive:     Transitional Technology TTY 8000 XL
                EXB 8500 compatibility mode
tape length:    112 m
tapetype info:  the EXB 8500 entry as provided in the example/amanda.conf
                of Amanda 2.3.0.

This works perfectly. If you have more accurate information so I can squeeze
more out of the tape I would be interested to hear about it.

Here is the tapetype we're using:

# According to my tests, length=4474 mbyts and filemark=40 kbytes
# (actually 39.4429- K).  We're being a bit conservative here - I've
# seen amanda overrun what it thought the tape size was by a few percent.
# Besides, the Exabyte book _says_ filemarks really are 48K.

define tapetype EXB-8500 {
    comment "Exabyte EXB-8500 drive on decent machine"
    length 4200 mbytes

}

From: Ralf Fassel <ralf@atg.venture.de>

We use the following on a DAT streamer (Conner/Seagate) w/o hardware
compression.  The filemark value is a wild guess and has worked so far.

  tapetype DAT # what kind of tape it is (see tapetypes below)
  define tapetype DAT {
	comment "DAT tape drives."
	length 2000 mbytes		# 90 m tape
	filemark 100 kbytes		# don't know about this one.
	speed 400 kbytes		# What the manual says.
    }

We have only few filesystems to back up (<15), so the filemark is not that
important for us.  The speed is actually more like 390k/s, but that's close
enough.

Subject: Re: tapetype for HPC1533A

The DIP switches do not have specific functions - think of it as an array and
the permutation of the switches gives a specific behaviour.

Extracted from INSTALLATION notes by Nigel Wade, University of Leicester for
his codes to interrogate a C1533A on an SGI machine.

For 90M DAT's I use
 define tapetype DAT2 {
    comment "DAT tape drives"
    length 1900000 kbytes # these numbers are not accurate
    filemark 100 kbytes         # but you get the idea
    speed 500 kbytes
}

No compression should give 2G but I lie and that way amanda rarely attempts to
write beyond the end of the tape!

  Here is what we use for our site. The tape is a Digital CompacTape III
  cartridge (also known as a TK85K).

library changer. I hope this helps.
