Amanda 2.5.0 - KERBEROS v5 SUPPORT NOTES

1. CONFIGURATION

The krb5 driver script defaults to:

/*
 * Where the keytab lives.  This should be configurable.
 */
#define AMANDA_KEYTAB   "/.amanda-v5-keytab"

/*
 * The name of the principal we authenticate with.  This should also
 * be configurable.
 */
#define AMANDA_PRINCIPAL        "service/amanda"

/*
 * The lifetime of our tickets in minutes.  This may or may not need to be
 * configurable.
 */
#define AMANDA_TKT_LIFETIME     (12*60)

/*
 * The name of the service in /etc/services.  This probably shouldn't be
 * configurable.
 */
#define AMANDA_KRB5_SERVICE_NAME        "k5amanda"


You can currently only override these by editing the source.

The configure script will search under /usr/kerberos/lib,
/usr/cygnus/lib, /usr/lib, and /opt/kerberos/lib for libkrb.a.  (in
that order) for the kerberos bits.  If it finds them, kerberos support
will be added in, if it doesn't, it won't.  If the kerberos bits are
found under some other hierarchy, you can specify this via the
--with-krb5-security=DIR, where DIR is where the kerberos bits live.
It'll look under the 'lib' directory under this hierarchy for
libkrb.a.

2. INSTALLATION

The kerberized Amanda service uses a different port on the client hosts.
The /etc/services line is:

    k5amanda      10082/tcp

And the /etc/inetd.conf line is:

    k5amanda stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/libexec/amanda/amandad amandad -auth=krb5

Note that you're running this as root, rather than as your dump user.
Amanda will set it's uid down to the dump user at times it doesn't need
to read the srvtab file, and give up root permissions entirely before
it goes off and runs dump.  Alternately you can change your srvtab files
to be readable by user amanda.

3. CONF FILE

The following dumptype options apply to krb5:

	auth "krb5"	use krb5 auth for this host
			(you can mingle krb hosts & bsd .rhosts in one conf)
