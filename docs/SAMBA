README for adding PC hosts to the Amanda backup system.

Release 2. 28/Jan/1997

Installation

First, Samba must be patched with the file samba-1.9.16p2.1.patch -
this is a patch for 1.9.16p2 of samba, and modifies the way the 'dir'
command works, and adds totals to both the dir command and the tar
command, via stderr.  These are used by Amanda to estimate and count
backup sizes.  This should be installed on an Amanda 'client' host,
that will act as the 'samba server' host.  This will most likely be the
same machine as the Amanda master server.  This patch also works fine
with newer releases of samba.

It is possible that releases newer than 1.9.16p11 of samba will not
require this patch.  When in doubt, try to apply the patch yourself.

Then, Amanda must be configured with smbclient support - when you
run configure, add the following argument:

 --with-smbclient=/full/path/to/smbclient

Setup

Once Amanda is installed, the only difference is in how the backup
disks are specified.  For each PC host disk, and entry is placed in the
disklist not for that host, but for the 'samba server' host, where the
patched samba suite is installed.  Instead of a path or a disk
specified in the space provided in the disklist for this purpose, a
sharename is listed.

Additionally, a file must be created called /etc/amandapass, which
includes a sharename to password mapping.  Each line of input
lists the sharename in 'Amanda format' (it is case sensitive so
make it identical to the sharename listed in the disklist) followed
by whitespace and then the password, which must not contain spaces.
This file must owned by the amanda user, and without world-read
privileges, or amcheck will complain.

The share must be given full access (read/write) to the disk -
otherwise incremental backups will not work and it will always backup
most of the disk (A bits never being reset).

e.g.

Amanda client software, and the patched samba is installed onto a host
'pcserver'.  A share to be backed up is called 'backupc' on host
'thepc'.  It has a password on the share of 'f00bar'.

The entry in the disklist file is:

pcserver	//thepc/backupc		nocomp-user-gnutar

^ samba installed unix host
                 ^ pc host and sharename
					^ dumptype must include the tar option

And in /etc/amandapass on the machine 'pcserver', this line must be
present :
//thepc/backupc f00bar

If smbclient would require a workgroup specification (-W), you may add
it as a third argument in /etc/amandapass line:
//thepc/backupc f00bar NTGROUP

This way, smbclient will be invoked with -W NTGROUP


An example dumptype (from amanda.conf) could be:

define dumptype nocomp-user-gnutar {
    program "GNUTAR"
    comment "user partitions dumped with tar and no compression"
    options no-compress
    priority medium
}

Essentially the disklist entry is a 'pseudo-disk' which contains all the
relevant information needed by the smbclient program to backup the disk,
but in an Amanda compatible way.  The full sharename shouldn't be greater
than 79 characters.  And the password should not include any whitespace.

For NT systems, or where the shares are specified with a username, the
username it connects with is 'backup'.  See bugs for some notes on
this.

amcheck does a quick check to see if smbclient exits and also tries to
connect to any appropriate hosts.  It also checks for the existence of
/etc/amandapass, and that the permissions are set appropriately.

Bugs

It seems impossible to detect when a per-user based login fails - e.g.
the username doesn't exist on an NT workstation.  It connects but you
can't see any files (e.g. backups backup nothing).  The selfcheck code
isn't particularly robust in this area either, so you can get no
warnings when a disk isn't being backed up.  Just check to see that
level 0 dumps are bigger than 64K - otherwise it means the backup was
empty.  (i have code in sendsize to detect this situation, but I don't
know how to flag it, without aborting every disk (or 'pseudo disk') on
that host).

The estimate and totals are probably a bit out, since tar pads to the
nearest 512 bytes after each file (i think).  Not sure how much of a
problem this is.

If you compile with smclient support, gnutar support is automatically
added too.  If you aren't using the gnutar part, you may get warnings
about the availability of /usr/local/bin/gtar (or whatever it was
compiled with) - these can safely be ignored.
