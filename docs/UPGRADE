Amanda Upgrade Issues

-----
Depending upon the version of Amanda you are upgrading from, Amanda may
use a different database library to store the backup information, and
the new Amanda may not be able to read the old Amanda database files.
In this case, you will want to do something like the following:

	amadmin-old CONFIG export > zzz
	amadmin-new CONFIG import < zzz
