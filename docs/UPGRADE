Amanda Upgrade Issues

-----

Amanda 2.4.0 has introduced a major incompatibility in the amanda
protocol.  This means that pre-2.4.0 clients won't interoperate with a
2.4.0 server, nor will 2.4.0 clients interoperate with pre-2.4.0
servers.  You have to upgrade them at once.

For easing the upgrade process, from release 2.4.0 on, amanda has
supported a configure flag (--with-testing) that will cause amanda to
use alternate service names (amanda-test) instead of the standard
ones.  Thus, you can maintain a production release of amanda working
while you test a new one.

-----
Depending upon the version of Amanda you are upgrading from, Amanda may
use a different database library to store the backup information, and
the new Amanda may not be able to read the old Amanda database files.
In this case, you will want to do something like the following:

	amadmin-old CONFIG export > zzz
	amadmin-new CONFIG import < zzz
